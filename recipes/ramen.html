            <li>Â½ cup gluten-free soy sauce (tamari)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon coconut oil</li>
            <li>4 cups beef broth</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons miso paste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>

    </p>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <h5>Step 1</h5>
        Combine steak and soy sauce in a plastic container with a lid. For best flavor results,
         marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours.
        <h5>Step 2</h5>
        Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.
        <h5>Step 3</h5>
        Heat coconut oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add steak and cook until firm and reddish-pink and juicy in the center,
         3 to 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center
          should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium-rare. 
        Remove from skillet and allow to rest for 10 minutes.
        <h5>Step 4</h5>
        While the steak is resting, combine broth, miso paste, garlic, and sesame oil in a saucepan over medium heat; 
        bring to a boil. Once broth is at a slow boil, add ramen noodles. Cook until noodles are soft, about 3 minutes. 
        Season with salt and pepper.
        <h5>Step 5</h5>
        Transfer broth and noodles to 2 bowls. Slice steak and place on top.
